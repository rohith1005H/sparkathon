Theme 2: Transforming retail supply chains: From inventory management to last-mile delivery
Idea: "FreshFlow AI: Predictive Perishables & Dynamic Last-Mile Routing"
Main Problem:
Inventory (Perishables): High spoilage rates for fresh produce and dairy due to inaccurate demand forecasting at a granular level and suboptimal stock rotation. This leads to waste and lost sales.
Last-Mile (Perishables): Delivering fresh groceries efficiently, especially during peak hours or in diverse weather conditions, while maintaining cold chain integrity and minimizing delivery times/costs is a huge challenge.
How You're Solving It:
An AI-powered system with two core modules:
Predictive Perishables Management:
Uses machine learning (historical sales, weather forecasts, local events, social media trends, seasonality) to predict demand for specific perishable items at individual store/fulfillment center levels with high accuracy.
Provides dynamic reordering suggestions and optimal stock rotation guidance (First-Expired-First-Out enhanced with demand signals).
Flags items nearing expiry for automated markdowns or donation triggers.
Dynamic Last-Mile Routing for Freshness:
Integrates with order management and considers the "freshness window" of items in an order.
Optimizes delivery routes in real-time based on traffic, weather, delivery capacity (own fleet, gig workers), and the urgency of delivering perishables.
Can prioritize orders with highly perishable items or suggest consolidation to ensure cold chain efficiency (e.g., grouping refrigerated deliveries).
Tech Stack Ideas: Python (for ML), TensorFlow/PyTorch, route optimization APIs (e.g., Google OR-Tools, Mapbox), IoT sensor data (for cold chain, optional for hackathon but good to mention).


Absolutely — here's a more natural, direct version without too much formality:

---

### **What’s your idea?**

An AI system that predicts demand for perishable goods and plans delivery routes that keep groceries fresh and waste low.

---

### **What problem are you solving?**

Stores throw away a lot of fresh produce and dairy because they can't predict demand accurately. On top of that, delivering these items fast — without spoiling — is tough, especially during traffic or bad weather.

---

### **How are you solving it?**

We're building two things:

1. A prediction model that looks at sales data, weather, local events, and trends to figure out how much of each perishable item a store really needs. It also helps rotate stock better and flags stuff that's about to expire.
2. A routing engine that plans deliveries in real time based on how quickly items need to get there, road conditions, and available delivery drivers — so fresh stuff actually stays fresh.
